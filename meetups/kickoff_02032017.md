## Distributed Systems group Kick-off 

### Agenda

Get together over some beers and discuss about how this meetup will be 
organized and think about potential sponsors, support companies, venues and also
what types of events we'd like to see (e.g. technical talks, hackatons, etc..)


- What do we want/expect from this community?
    
- Distributed systems is a wide a broad area of tech. Narrow it down or keep it general and wide?
  
    - blockchain
    - distributed vs descentralised

- Meetup model:

  - traditional beer&talks
  - 'show me a research paper' sessions
  - 'show me a technology' session
  - hackatons
 
- Discussion forum for the community (github/gitter/slack/mailing list?)

- distsys github project. Lets build something that members can contribute to.

- Potential speakers and topics

- Next steps
